# Knight-Tour

## Overview
Solves the Knight tour problem using a semi-brute force approach. There is a GUI made in Java and the approach is to prioritize the edges and corners so that the knight lands on them first. All moves are made randomly and a thread is used for pacing. 

## Required
- Java 15.0 or later

I would like to extend this by cloning it and converting it into a working chess game.
